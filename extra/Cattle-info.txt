 They stop the vehicles and create a traffic jam. I do not think they are good for anyone here.
 They just dirty the roads and prevent the flow of traffic. It is just so annoying.
 It is bad for them as they eat trash and then get sick. It is so sad to see this.
 I am very afraid for them. They could cut or poison themselves eating the trash out here.
 As many as they are here, I do not think it is safe to have them roam about the streets.
