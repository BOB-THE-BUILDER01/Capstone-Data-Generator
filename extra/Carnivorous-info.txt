 They are agitated. I feel in this state, they will kill someone. I hope this is looked to immediately.
 I am in danger of my life. They could kill a human. I hope someone comes fast.
 These are wild animals that hide. If it hid and pounced on an unsuspecting person, this would have been very different.
 A crowd has now gathered around this, which is horrible. I hope someone takes note and take them away.
 This is becoming more dangerous by the second. Hope this reaches to the appropriate authorities immediately.
 I am surprised no one had noticed this before. They kill people. I hope someone catches them soon.
