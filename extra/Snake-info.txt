 I feel that snakes in general are safe, but these seemed agitated. They can cause some serious damage it nothing can be done soon enough.
 Snakes always gave me the creeps, but this seems like a dangerous one. Left alone, someone unsuspecting might step on it and get seriously hurt.
 They seem to be agitated and almost bit one of my friends who was unfortunate to discover it. I don't want to go closer to it.
 This is most definitely a poisonous snake. I think it is only right that someone experienced come to deal with this right away.
 This is a venomous snake. It almost bit me when I was cleaning my place. It must have gotten in through the window I usually keep open at night.
 I lived in a forest. For a snake, this is very agitated and chased down one of the delivery drivers. I think this is urgent.
 This problem has never happened before. But I am sure that this is not a normal tree snake. It hisses at us when I try to go closer.
