 They make too much noise. It is bad. I hope this gets over soon.
 The smell is unbearable. Especially during the rains. It got so horrible yesterday that I had to sleep elsewhere.
 It is very dirty, but it is left to the elements. I do not think that this is good.
 This looks like it needs attention. It keeps crowing all day. It is becoming annoying.
 The feathers, the smell, the noise. It is just becoming too much. I hope this gets resolved soon.
 I cannot start to list all the problems with this. It just seems too much for me to list here.
 I feel bad for the situation it is in, but at the same time, I do not know what to make of this.
 It is a nuisance here. As much I would like to accomodate and adjust, this is becoming too much.
