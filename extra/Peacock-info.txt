 It is very surprising that I see such beautiful creatures being faced against the circumstances here. It saddens me.
 While beautiful as they are, I feel their shrieks are very loud and jarring especially in the city.
 It is a sorry state of affairs for the peacock, but they can get agitated and I fear that. It should be tended to immediately.
 They have been agitated before and can become very dangerous. I am worried for the passerby who might get attacked unprovoked as well.
 It can be problematic when it shreiks. It is very loud and can be dangerous if provoked.
 It is a wild animal. It will attack people if it sees them as a threat. So far I have seen it attack 2 people.
 It looks very beautiful. I am surprised that they are dangerous and can peck you hard. 
 It seems very out of place for such a beautiful animal. Looking forward for the right authorites to take control of the situation.
