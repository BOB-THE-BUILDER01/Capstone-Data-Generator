 Very surprising to see something like this even be here. It seems to be distressed.
 I did not find it's owner. It seems lost and afraid. It might attack people.
 It kept shreiking all night yesterday. No one in our street could sleep properly. Nobody even knows how to approach this.
 Unfortunate to see such a majestic animal being exposed to such a situation. It is very distressed and sick.
 I think it needs immediate attention. They are nice animals, just that it's situation makes it a bit dangerous for the people around.
