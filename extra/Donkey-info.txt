 It is pretty rare sight, but a sad one nonetheless. I pity the poor thing.
 It got pretty aggressive when someone tried to approach it. I was scared.
 The poor thing has been bleating the whole time. It is cold this time of the year and I pity it.
 I would love to see it in a good place. Right now, it looks injured and hungry as well.
 It wouldn't feel appropriate to leave this right here. But I am not in a position to help such an animal right now.
 It looks dirty and has been trashing the streets. I think this could be a health problem for us.
