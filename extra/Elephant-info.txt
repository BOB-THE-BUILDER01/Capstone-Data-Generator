 Seriously, an elephant? It is too much. Too loud, too dirty.
 I hope someone takes a look at these poor animals. They are being subject to this situation and I feel bad.
 I might just be inclined to take a look myself, but they can be very dangerous. I hope this gets resolved soon.
 The loud noises is what got me. I cannot do this for my sanity anymore. I want this to open a line of enquiry and have this resolved ASAP.
 It is depressing to see a majestic animal like this has to endure. Regardless, I hope it gets a good home.
 All of my heart goes out to this poor thing, but I feel they do not belong to the city. I cannot take it anymore.
 They can get dangerous and destroy property pretty easily. I hope this is fixed.
 It is an elephant. They are so big. How they managed to do this is beyond me.
 I heard that elephants can get angry and dangerous. I hope this doesn't happen before the authorities take hold of the situation.
