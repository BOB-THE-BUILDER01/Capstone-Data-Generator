 I am pretty sure that they are wild. They get very aggressive and I am afraid of anyone who passes by them.
 This is dangerous to everyone around as they keep harassing the hawkers and vendors nearby.
 They have shorted eletric lines, caused nuisance all day and through the night. It is very unbecoming of this neighbourhood of such pests.
 They are simply pests. They have hurt people as I am writing this. It can get dangerous pretty fast.
 They make too much noise when they are in groups like these. I feel unsafe even walking around my house.
 I cannot think of any other animal that has caused as much havoc as these pests. It is not good.
 I am pretty sure that these critters are unvaccinated. Any one person they attack might be prone to rabies.
 The noise is becoming too much for me. I hope this gets resolved soon enough.
