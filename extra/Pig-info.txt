 It has already hit into 3 oncoming scooters and hurt 5 of them. No one is daring to walk near it and caused a traffic pile up on the road.
 These pigs have already broken into several garbage cans and it has spread around the horrible smell and other vectors are on the increase. It is a huge problem.
 I cannot start to think about the kinds of problems these animals could unleash in our society. I do not think they belong here.
 They are a pest. They tear down garbage cans, posters and make a general mess of the place. It is disgusting.
 They cause all kinds of problems. It feels like I live in a slum. It does not feel right.
 I know that they are animals, but I really cannot see my beautiful society turn into a dump becuase of these. It is a bad image.
