 They make so much noise, it is becoming really bad.
 They litter all over our balconies, cars and pathways. It is double work for the keepers in our complex.
 They just come in and litter all over. It has been a nuisance for quite some time now.
 I cannot even start on how annoying these critters are. I can assure you that they are very dirty and smell bad.
 It used to be a nice place to stay before they came in. I do not like it one bit.
