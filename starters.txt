 I was going on for a morning walk when I noticed a $ just down the road across the gutter.
 It was late at night when I was coming back from work when I noticed nearby there was whining from a $.
 Early in the morning whenever there was rain, I could hear a $ belching for hours on end but I didn't know what to do about it until now.
 Bangalore is really cold during this time. I couldn't help but realise that a $ near where I stay would just stand and scream in the early hours.
 I cycle every morning. I noticed this $ today when I was cycling my usual route. It wasn't there before.
 I cycle every night on the weekends. I noticed this $ yesterday night when I was cycling in the usual route. I haven't noticed it there before.
 There is a lot of commotion going on recently where I stay. I saw a $ that is causing a lot of nuisance nearby.
 I recently moved in to this new area which is still under development. There are a lot of $s moving about. They cause nuisance and shriek through nights sometimes.
 I had come across a $ near where I stay. I am not sure what to make of it so I am writing a report here.
 My neighbours had recently moved in. I noticed something was wrong from the get go.
 I recently moved into this area. The neighbours did not seem very friendly when I tried to ask about the $ they had. I felt something was wrong.
