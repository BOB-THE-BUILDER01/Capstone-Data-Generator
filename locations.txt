 I live near the railroad in Sarjapur. Caramellam to be precise.
 I live near Hosa Road, in an apartment near the Police Station over there. 
 I am currently residing in Ashok Nagar, near Brigade Road.
 I stay in a colony in Marathalli. This is really close to the main road itself.
 I am in an apartment in Bellandur, which is close to the mall.
 I stay in an independant house near the 27th Main in HSR. It is really busy in the area.
 My location is near the MRP shop near the signal on Hosur Road for Hosa Road.
 The place where I found this was near Cubbon park, towards the main entrance.
 It must have moved by now, but the last I saw it was when I was travelling from Agara to Sarjapur, on that road.
