 While I was aware that they sold animals, the fact they sell $ is beyond me. This is not right. It is an exotic that needs saving.
 $'s are out of limits. How could they sell such beautiful creatures? This is disgusting.
 I saw a couple of $s the other day. They did not answer when I asked if they were selling them. This is an exotic animal that needs to be in forests, not sold.
 While I was searching for a pet before, I came across this place. Run down and looked shady. When I saw a $ there, I immediately came here. This is the right thing to do, I hope.
 Many times I came across them selling animals before. This was normal. But I heard they also sell $. When I tried to ask questions, they avoided me. I am fairly certain that they sell $.
 While I was actively searching for a pet for my friend, I came across this place. I had stumbled upon this poor $ here. It is a rare and an exotic.
 I saw a $ selling there. It is wrong and illegal for an exotic to be treated this way.
 A $ at a pet shop? This is illegal.
