 I keep seeing these animals breed and no one to take care of them. At one point they might just be pests. They should be neutered.
 These animals have kept multiplying without any restraint here. They have become pests. I think it is time to neuter them.
 I love animals and do not wish them killed, but there are just too many animals. I hope they can be neutered.
 These $s have become a nuisance in the last couple of years. They have been steadily growing and trashing our neighbourhood. I hope they are neutered.
 So many of these $s here. They bully other animals and are a problem to us and our pets here.
 I love $s, but there are just too many of them here to the point where they attack other pets and animals as well.
 I tried to feed these $s, but it was a mistake. They have multiplied so fast that they are becoming problematic. I do not want them killed.
 I found a couple young $s following the noise. They may seem cute, but the situation in our neighbourhood is becoming worse by the day. I hope they can control it without killing them.
 Last couple of years have been rough for us staying here. These pests have dirtied our area for a long time. I hope this can be controlled without killing them.
