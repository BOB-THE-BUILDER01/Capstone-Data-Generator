 I followed the noise and then I noticed a weak whimper from this $. It was very weak. I gave it some food, but I think it needs more care than that.
 I then saw an extremely malnourished $ just lying there.
 The neighbours had these pets for a long time and I suspect they do not feed their pets. It is becoming concerning.
 For a long time I noticed this $ roaming about that was very weak. I think it is malnourished since our neighbourhood gives some food to these animals.
 I saw a $ there where it was laying down. It is because it was very weak. I am afraid it might die.
 I saw a malnourished $. It had a lot of diseases becuase of this.
 I couldn't look away from this poor $. It was very weak. I could see all of it's bones.
 The $ was whimpering when I found it. It was barely able to move.
 My neighbour's dog looked underfed when I moved in. It has been 6 months and it still looks very weak. I think it is being harassed.
