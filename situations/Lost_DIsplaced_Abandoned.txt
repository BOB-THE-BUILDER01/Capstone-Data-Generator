 This poor $ looks like someone left it to it's devices. It follows everyone and looks lost.
 That is how I found this abandoned $. It looked like it depended on humans since it was very weak despite other strays being healthy.
 So, a well trained $ came up to me like that. I think someone lost their pet.
 I found a $ with clothes on. It didn't have a tag.
 That is how I came about this poor $ wandering about, following random people on the street. It looks lost.
 Then I saw a couple of $ that looked like pets. They seem lost. I think they require help.
 Most of the animals out here look healthy enough, but this poor $ couldn't hold their own. I suspect that it is a pet and it's lost.
 I found a source of the distress. A $ who looked lost.
 In this place I found a $ hiding from what looks like other animals. It looks like a pet and is lost.
