 I keep seeing youngins regularly everytime. It doesn't seem like this is normal. Since it is an apartment, it is common to see different people, but an unseemingly large amount of people frequent at particular times. Since it smells like a zoo and there are lots of animals there, I think they are running an illegal breeding scheme.
 I have a strong suspicion that what they are doing isn't very legal. Breeding these poor creatures again and again. The parents look weak and underfed. I feel bad for them.
 The animals look like they live in dirty and dilapidated conditions. Yet, I see lots of young ones all year around. I think they are running an illegal breeding operation.
 They have a lot of animals in a very small space. This apartment doesn't seem big enough for so many of them. I sense something Illegal is going on.
 I think that they are running an illegal operation from the apartments. It is unsanitary and draws unwanted noise and attention all the time. 
 Sometimes the smell and the noise from them are unbearable. I cannot anymore. Upon further questioning, I got to know that they are running something illegal, breeding these poor animals.
 Lots of the same pet, I am starting to think they are running a business here. It looks illegal from the likes of it as well.
 It seems like that they have auctions from their apartments itself. I feel this is illegal and wrong. Those poor things are cramped in a small space becuase our apartments here are already small.
