 I saw the $, just by itself. I think it needs to be rescued. It looks alone as no one is willing to take it in.
 While looking around, I found the $ just cold and in a corner. It looked like something was blocking it's mouth.
 The $ seemed to be in trouble. It couldn't speak, as if something was stuck in it's throat.
 There is waste dump nearby. I think the animals regularly eat from there. The $ I found was choking on a piece of plastic. It wouldn't let anyone near it.
 I saw a $ that got stuck in the fence. It wouldn't let anyone come near it. While it is scared, it hurts itself even more by moving.
 I couldn't do look at it as the $ was infected at the head. It was because of some plastic that was tightly wound around the head. It looked like it was in a lot of pain.
 I was trying to locate the sound and I saw the $ who was injured from the garbage dump. Some metal shard has punctured it's shoulder.
