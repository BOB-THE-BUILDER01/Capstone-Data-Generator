 I wanted to give this one up for adoption because I do not think anyone here would be willing to take it up.
 I feel pity for the poor animal. I am willing to take it to the vet to have it treated. But I wanted to put it up for adoption.
 I don't think that it is right to leave it in such a state. I think this platform can provide a good home through this complaint.
 This has been going for quite some time. It seems really distressed. While I cannot provide for it, I hope to reach out about adoption and look for caring owners.
 While I would love to keep it for myself, the place where I stay and my situation doesn't allow me to do so. I hope someone could adopt it.
 It seems wrong to keep out such a cute thing. I really want to take care of it, but I simply cannot. I hope someone can adopt it.
 I will personally provide expenses to have it nursed back to health, but I want someone to look after it. I hope someone is willing to adopt.
 The hostile environment outside seems too harsh for this poor thing. I do not think it will last long like this. I hope to reach out to keen adopters.
 It can be daunting to take care of an animal like a bachelor myself, but I hope someone more well standing could adopt it.
