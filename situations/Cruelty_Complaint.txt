 I keep hearing hurtful shrieks and noises like it is in pain. I do not claim to distinguish different sounds, but this seems very uncomfortable to listen to everyday.
 This cannot keep going on for longer. I have kept hearing it cry late at night and all the way into the next day. This is very cruel. I hope someone looks into it.
 While my neighbour seems like a nice person, I do not think they are capable of taking care of an animal. Their screams just make my heart drop. Day in and day out. Seems like they are being punished.
 I never owned pets, but I feel it is a bad sign when your pet keeps howling all day long. It just doesn't seem normal.
 I saw it the other day while I was on a walk. It had unnatural bruises and it was limping. I feel that it is being abused. I really want to do something about this.
 While no one owns it, I keep seeing fresh bruises and injuries. It will die if this goes on for much longer. I feel this seriously needs being looked into.
 I might be biased, but as a pet owner myself, I keep seeing this poor animal limping with the owner showing no concern for it. I feel this would open an enquiry into this.
 Cannot put a finger on it, but I feel that these injuries are just unnatural while the owner claims otherwise. If I am true or not, this seems very cruel.
 Gut wrenching shrieks in the middle of the night startled me the other day. Since I started my night shift, I started noticing it more. More enquiry led to it being shut down immediately. I think something bad it happening.
 I have a gut feeling that this poor creature might be enduring abuse from the physical symptoms that I am seeing. It does not look normal.
