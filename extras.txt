 I recently moved in to the neighbourhood and I did not know about this place. When I was taking a walk today, I saw this.
 I was not aware that something like this would happen in our colony. I expected this place to be more safe.
 An unexpected turn of events had made me to take a look here. This is what I had uncovered. I was startled when I first discovered this.
 I feel uneasy even trying to think about all of this. It makes the area look bad and doesn't feel like anyone is doing anything about this.
 It has been many years since I moved here and this is just one of the many instances where this place feels less like a home. Pests, strays and dust occupy the streets and sidewalks.
 The place is not the same as it used to be before, I do not know how or when it changed.
 I come from another village far away from here. I was aware that the city mught be a little cramped, but this is a bit much.
 While it is not unexpected that something like this is here, just that the frequency of this happening is very un becoming of this place.
 I cannot even start to fathom of how frustrating it is for me to complain this. I paid extra to live in a better neighbourhood and this is what comes of it.
 I am very upset that something like this would happen in a posh area of Bangalore like this. I did not expect it at all.
