 This took some time for me to think about and now I firmly believe that this is true. I suspect that a person in our building have some sort of an illegal operation for $. I have heard lots of noise over the 2 years that I was here.
 I think that our neighbours aren't who they think they are. I have a strong suspicion that they might be doing some illegal business with $'s.
 There is not a lot I complain about the people who live around me, but I feel this is warranted. I suspect our neighbours of shady activity with $'s as I keep hearing tens of them everyday.
 I take it that this complaint would open a line of enquiry about our neighbours. I think they might have some dealings with $s as I keep seeing different kinds of $s everytime and none of them are the same.
 I had my reservations about my neighbours but didn't think much of it.Since then I recently stumbled upon an industrial sized cage in our small house locality. It supports the suspicion I had that they were dealing with $s on a large scale.
 I am not a very noisy neighbour and I try to keep to myself, but I cannot withstand my neighbours who's $s keep shreiking all day and all night. Their numbers suggest that they might have some sort of a business going on. I think this must be investigated.
 Lately, I have had new neighbours who do not seem very friendly. I didn't think much of it until I realised how many $s they had. Ok, maybe a few as pets I'd understand, but this is too many. I think that that they have something else going on.
 My neighbours opposite to our house has a lot of $s and people frequenting the place. I am under the suspicion that they might have something illegal going on.
 We live basically right next door. When I first moved in, I didn't think much of it but I soon started to notice horrible smells, like that of $s coming from their place. Any enquiry would be immediately shut down.
